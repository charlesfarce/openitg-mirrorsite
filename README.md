# openitg-mirrorsite
Recreation of https://openitg.gr-p.com/ documentation and (some) mirrored dlc files/patches.

The purpose of this lil' project is to modernize the layout, simplify navigation, and update external links for the original site.
Since the project has been archived, I wanted to keep a record of early documentation just in case the website becomes abandoned.

The goal? For anyone interested in OpenITG's history, builds, or for reverse engineering purposes.
